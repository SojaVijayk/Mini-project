# Book Story Content Feature

This document explains how to implement the full story content feature for the Book Bot application.

## Overview

The feature allows users to view the complete story of a book when they click the "Start Reading" button on the book description page.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Schema Update

A new column `story_content` has been added to the `book_table`:

```sql
ALTER TABLE book_table ADD COLUMN story_content LONGTEXT DEFAULT NULL AFTER description;
```

### 2. Backend Changes (app.py)

- Modified the book description route to include story content
- Added automatic creation of the story_content column if it doesn't exist
- Added sample story content for existing books

### 3. Frontend Changes (book_description.html)

- Added a new section to display the full story content
- Modified the "Start Reading" button functionality to show the story content
- Added CSS styling for the story section

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Update Database Schema

Run the following SQL command in your MySQL database:

```sql
ALTER TABLE book_table ADD COLUMN story_content LONGTEXT DEFAULT NULL AFTER description;
```

### 2. (Optional) Populate with Sample Content

Run the populate_story_content.py script to add sample story content for testing:

```bash
python populate_story_content.py
```

## How It Works

1. When a user visits a book description page, they see the book's basic information and description
2. When they click the "Start Reading" button:
   - The description section is hidden
   - The full story content section is displayed
   - The page scrolls to the story content
3. Users can read the complete story directly on the page

## Customization

To add real story content for your books:

1. Update the `story_content` field in the `book_table` for each book
2. You can store the complete text of the story in this field
3. The content will be displayed with proper formatting when users click "Start Reading"

## Notes

- The story content is displayed with `white-space: pre-line` CSS property to preserve line breaks
- The feature maintains the existing navigation and design patterns of the application
- For large story texts, consider implementing pagination or chapter navigation in future enhancements
